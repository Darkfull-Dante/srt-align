# SRT Align
SRT Align is a CLI software that can edit timestamp in an SRT file (SubRip) to align the timing with the video Source. The tool can help for two types of offset:

- **Shift**: help with different duration of files and one source is faster than the other
- **Linear**: when the subtitle is always slightly before or being the video source due to wrong start time
